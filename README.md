Project: Potato Disease Detection App

Description: Developed a machine learning application to detect potato diseases using image classification.

Key Responsibilities:

Model Development: Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification to accurately identify various potato diseases.
API Development: Utilized FastAPI and Uvicorn to create a robust and scalable API for serving the machine learning model.
Deployment: Integrated MLOps practices to ensure continuous integration and deployment of the model, maintaining high availability and performance.
Collaboration: Worked closely with a DevOps student to deploy the application on a cloud platform, ensuring seamless integration and operational efficiency.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure
